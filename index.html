    <h2>Vietnam</h2>
    <p>
        First on the list is the fabulous Vietnam. A cultural & culinary delight, offering wonderful hospitality and a variety of experiences to enjoy. 
    </p>

    <p>Some of my absolute must see's are:
        <ul>
           <li> Ha long Bay - take a boat trip to see the fishing village made famous on Top Gear.</li>
           <li> Hoi An - especially the full moon festival and all of the tailor stores.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

            <img src="/Images/Vietnam/IMG_2175.JPG" alt="Snorkling at Cham Island, Hoi An" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;">
           
     <h2>Maldives</h2>
     <p>
        Next up is The Maldives. A true paradise. The islands are accessible only by boat or sea plane, I've honestly never been anywhere like it. 
     </p>
     <p>
        We chose to stay at Kurumba, a lovely island a short 15 minute boat ride from the airport at Male.

     <p>
        The colour of the sea and beaches is just pristine, the range of sea life is varied. Reef sharks and turtles frequent the area. We also witnessed pods of dolphins swimming by.
